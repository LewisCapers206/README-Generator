This assignment allows a user to be able to create a readme file through nodejs. It gives them the ability to 
anwser questions and create a readme file.

Overall I thought that this assignment went very well. I cam across a few problems that took me some time to figure out

This assignment was challenging enough, I had to double check my functions and do some reasearch so that I could get it to work properly.

I did really enjoy it though, seeing it come together makes the work worth it.
